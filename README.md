ngTouch
=======

My own AngularJS directives for mobile user gesture.

This is from my old project. I used Angular 1.0 after it was produced. So there is no ngTouch directive at that time. Although there is ngTouch now, I am still familiar with this one.

It contains gestures, including tap, swipe four directions, and scroll for mobile devices.
